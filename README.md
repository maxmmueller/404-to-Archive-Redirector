This extension is your solution to 404 dead ends. It automatically redirects you to a saved version in the Wayback Machine for a seamless browsing experience.

There's a standalone Chrome extension and a Greasemonkey script, that provide the same functionality.


## Greasemonkey/ Tampermonkey setup 
Create a new script in your Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey extension and simply paste the content of the [`404_to_Wayback.js`](404_to_Wayback.js) file into it.
