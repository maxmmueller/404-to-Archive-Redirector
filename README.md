# 404-to-Archive-Redirector

Inspired by: [Aayush](https://github.com/Divide-By-0/ideas-for-projects-people-would-use?tab=readme-ov-file#programming-tools)

This is a Greasemonkey/ Tampermonkey script that will redirect you to the Wayback Machine, if you land on an unavailable 404 page.

If no stored version is found in the Wayback Machine, nothing happens.

## Usage
Create a new script in your Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey extension and simply paste the content of the [`404_to_Wayback.js`](404_to_Wayback.js) file into it.
